# Cyber4OT: ICS network traces containing normal activity and full attack traffic

The Cyber4OT dataset contains prepared in the test-bed environment packet
traces from normal activity of OT network, as well as, full network attack.
During recorded activity, the attacker performs full network reconnaissance,
later disconnects legal Modbus TCP connection and performs PLC device hijacking.

The dataset contains 96 files with more than 4,25 millions of packets.

Detailed desription of the test bed, where data was prepared, is provided in 
the Cyber4OT_testbed_description.pdf file.

The most recent version of dataset (currently version 1.0.3) is also available from 
Zenodo - [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15005190](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15005190)
